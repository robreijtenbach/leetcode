### Leetcode

In this repo I keep some of the Leetcode problems I solved. This repo does not contain every problem I solved as some problems were done entirely in the Leetcode editor instead of a local editor.

Found this hack when checking the fastest solution after submitting problem 5.
'''python
__import__("atexit").register(lambda: open("display_runtime.txt", "w").write("0"))
'''
It sets the runtime to 0 which you could use to impress your friends.
